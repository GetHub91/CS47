# CS 47

This repository houses assignments for Stanford's Cross-Platform Mobile Development course, CS 47. 

Although the instructors have stated this course is meant to be collaborative, and that the honor code is not to be feared, Stanford students should proceed with caution before accessing these files. To copy the contents of this repository without understanding the material would undermine the academic integrity of the course. CS 47 was created by students, for students, and the primary purpose of the assignments is to provide interested students with exposure and competency.

I'll include the provided specifications with each assignment so that unenrolled developers with intellectual vitality may give an honest attempt at learning React Native. Check history for starter files.
